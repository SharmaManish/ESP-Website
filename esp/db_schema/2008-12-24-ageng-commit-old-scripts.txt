Review the update script 2008-12-24-ageng-commit-old-scripts.py.
This update re-runs two previous scripts that might not have made any changes
    because I forgot to put transaction.commit() at the end.
2008-11-27-ageng.py still worked, since Django commits when it saves stuff.

The script can be run with:
    $ ./manage.py shell
    >>> run ../db_schema/2008-12-24-ageng-commit-old-scripts.py

Actions taken by the script:
    Run 2008-12-13-ageng.py to update ClassSubject.duration
    Run 2008-12-14-ageng.py to update Program.director_email
        and ClassRegModuleInfo.director_email
    Actually commit the changes to the database this time.
