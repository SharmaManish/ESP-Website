You must show up to HSSP on Saturday, March 15 to complete your registration.  Check-in will be held in the lobby of MIT building 10 at 9:00 AM.  After 10:00 AM, newly arriving students should go to the HSSP office (room 1-134).  Signs will lead you to both locations from the main entrance of MIT at 77 Massachusetts Ave.<br />
<br />
You must bring the <a href="http://esp.mit.edu/media/uploaded/08_02/hssp_liability_medical.pdf">HSSP medical and liability forms</a>, filled out and signed by a guardian, by March 15th in order for you to participate in the remainder of HSSP.  <i> These forms are different from the ones you brought for Spark, so please make sure to bring these!</i>  Some classes might require additional forms.
</p>
<p>
We would like you to have a good idea of what you can expect from us and what we can expect from you, so we've posted a <a href="http://esp.mit.edu/media/uploaded/08_02/student_agreement_sp08.pdf">student agreement form</a>.  Please carefully read it, then sign it and bring it on March 15th.
