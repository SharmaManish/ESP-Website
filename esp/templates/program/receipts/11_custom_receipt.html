Your class selection for {{program.niceName}} has been saved. You can come back and change your class selections later, up until 2 days before {{one}} begins.
</p>

<p>
Please note that this does not <em>guarantee</em> enrollment in any class.
You <u>must</u> show up to HSSP on the registration day (Sunday, July 1st) to complete your registration.  Registration will be held in the lobby of MIT building 13 at 9:00am on July 1.  After 1:00pm, newly arriving students should go to the HSSP office.<br />
<br />
We would like you to have a good idea of what you can expect from us and what we can expect from you, so we've posted a <a href="/media/uploaded/07_06/student_agreement.pdf">student agreement form</a>.  Please carefully read it, then sign it and bring it to the first day of HSSP.
<br />
<br />
The <a href="/media/uploaded/07_06/liabilityandmedical_su07.pdf">medical and liability forms</a> must be filled out and signed by a guardian in order for you to participate in HSSP.  Some classes might require additional forms.
<br />
<br />
Please check back if you can to see if any more classes get added! Some teachers do not register their classes until later, so you may see some after you have preregistered. You are welcome to come back and change your class selection.
<p>
