    Your application to {{ program.niceName }} has been submitted. Please note, each teacher is going to review the applications for his/her class. Now that you confirmed your registration, we can read over your application. <br />
<strong>You will not be penalized for confirming an application closer to the deadline, May 25<sup>th</sup>.</strong>  If you have time between now and the deadline, please consider revising your application.
</p>

<p>
  If the teachers for the class that you selected opted for a diagnostic test,
  you will be informed via e-mail that you must take it to proceed with the 
  application process.
</p>
<p>
  Whether or not we contact you regarding a diagnostic test, we will e-mail 
  you about a week after the application deadline with final application and financial aid
  decisions.
