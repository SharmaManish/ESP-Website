<b>Payment details</b>: Please pay by check (made to "Splash! at Northwestern").  The base tuition cost is $200, which can also be paid for by credit card though our web site.  Please add $150 to your payment for a textbook deposit (which will be refunded at the end of the year), and $84 for AP test registration (which will be refunded in January if you choose not to take the AP test).  The fees are non-refundable after the first 3 weeks of class; the deadline for requesting refunds is Sunday, September 30, 2007.  You must turn in the textbook deposit before you can receive a book for your class; and you must turn in the test registration fee if you would like to take the AP test.  All of these charges are subject to financial aid; we will read review your applications, and e-mail you our aid decisions by Sunday, September 7.
